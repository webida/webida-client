Webida: Concept
============

**Multiple Viewpoint**

1. Webida is a rich/powerful **web based IDE** (web app, development tools run in browser) for developing web app (page)
    * Webida is written in Webida (Self-hosting)
2. Webida is a set of **editable** web pages (**a site**)
    * Different from Wiki: can edit web page (HTML), directly \(assumed to be hard\)
    * With tools (platform) for web development (differentiation)
3. Webida is a **network** of distributed Webida server (**set of sites**)
    * All Webida site/service will be connected
    * Account sharing, Connected service/site, Usage data sharing, Point/Profit sharing
4. Webida is **Web OS**
    * OS = runtime (browser) \+ apps (web pages/services) \+ development system (Tools & FW)
    * Enabling development system (tools, FW) in terms of Web App completes Web OS
    * In Webida world, users (developer, app user) need not go back to Host (native) OS
        * Web Browser executes everything: All Apps, Development Tools/Env., Office,  …
        * Rich services for connecting native world will be added/supported (naturally)
    * No install/update: SW (including OS stack) is serviced by each Webida site
5. Webida is **PaaS/dPaaS** (new style: distributed)
    * IAAS is just implementation detail (server infra, BSP things) in the top-down view

Webida: Webida Apps
============

**In general, Webida targets every app you are using in a host-PC (native OS),
which continously evloves (potentially open to all)**

* A Web site: Documents, Portal, …
* Tools & systems for developing HTML5 pages (apps)
    * Webida itself is developed a web app
    * IDE, UI builder, development system (SCM, build, issue, project), …
    * As with Android SDK host-OS, Cross-platform tools are also possible
* Desktop environment: personalized (specialized) PC environment
* Contents: slides, e-book, multimedia, …
* Developer’s network: homepages, social, …
* Back-end Services: nothing more than “Chargeable Libraries”
    * Account, Index, ranking, data sharing, static web app analysis, …


<br>

Webida: Goal (present)
============

* Creating New Open Platform (web based)
    * Web (HTML5) revisited
        * Q: Can web replace natives? A: Can native replace web?
        * Meeting the demand of the days (I bet)
            * Rich proven references for web apps to be real-world apps: offices, games, portal, …
            * Cross-platform (devices): where the [puck is going](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWlke27s0DI) ([Inventing on principle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII))
        * A reference: success of Linux
    * Super player?  No
        * Web platform is gray zone (instinct)
            * Not to be owned by Microsoft, Apple, Google, Samsung, et. al.
        * If any super player is possible, it might be developer’s network (or tool)
            * Again: enabling web based development = Web OS = new PaaS/Cloud
    * Q: Why?, A: Why not?
* Business Model
    * All kind of platform businesses is open to us
    * We will concentrate on building “open” echo system (in phase1)
        * To have “fair” ownership on core component (development system)
    * One concrete way to go
        * Developer-centric (return profit) open platform: Social, Hacker’s world (government

<br>

Webida: Our Appaorch
============

* Open innovation
    * We won’t be able to keep up with the phase of development/innovation on web world (Who can do that?)
        * Better way to create SW & innovate
        * Not strategy actually, but instinct
    * [Code wins arguments](http://video.linux.com/videos/tizen-developer-conference-2012-opening-keynote-from-jim-zemlin)
    * Open evolution system
        * Continuous (easy) addition/evolution/distribution of Information/Tool/App
* Phase1: Tools (Bootstrapping)
    * A competitive web page (app) development tools & system
* Phase2: Platform-ing
    * Webida clustering: account, developer’s network, data sharing, profit sharing, …
    * Evolution system (big data): indexing, searching, ranking system for everything
